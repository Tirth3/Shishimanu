# Contributing to Shishimanu 🐾

Thank you for considering contributing! 🎉
This document outlines the contribution workflow and best practices.
This project follows a **simple GitHub Flow**: everything happens through branches and pull requests.


## Workflow

- **`main`** → The default branch. All contributions are merged here.
- **`feature/*`** → For new features.
- **`fix/*`** → For bug fixes.

👉 **Never commit directly to `main`.**
👉 All work should be done in a branch and merged via pull request.
